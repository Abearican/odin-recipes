    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nectar Milk is an excellect drink to have before bed. I prefer it cold, but it is also delicious if you want to heat up your milk. Incredibly simple and honestly really unhealthy. You probably should not have this but I am a fatty and a stoner and like to eat weird things.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Cinnamon (optional)</li>
        <li>Sprayable whipped cream (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If desired, drizzle some honey (or other syrup type condiment) on the inside edge of your glass.</li>
