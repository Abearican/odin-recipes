# odin-recipes

In this lesson I got familiar with working with lists, images, and other simple html elements. I also know how to construct the html boilerplate and link to other pages. Honestly I knew all this stuff but I still wanna kinda do the assignment so I only did one recipe lol. Also nectar milk is a real thing in my friend group.
